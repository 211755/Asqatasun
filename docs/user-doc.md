## Four kinds of audit

### Page audit

Typical usage:

* test a given webpage (e.g. the home page, a given article, the contact page...)

### Full site audit

Typical usage:

* test a whole site, i.e. each single page of the site (that may be huge !)

(Heritrix crawler embedded)

### Scenario audit 

Typical usage:

* page with authentication
* form with multiple steps (i.e. along more than one page)
* electronic procedures
* web application

### Offline file audit

(That's the DOM that is tested, thus dealing with JS/AJAX/ARIA)
