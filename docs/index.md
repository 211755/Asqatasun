## Problem & solution

Making your website better is hard. Better for users, better for developers,
better for the client. [W3C standards](http://www.w3.org/TR/) can bring a lot of
 help, but they are kind of tedious to understand and implement.

[Tanaguru](http://www.tanaguru.com/) helps you in making your web site 
accessible. It tests your pages, whole site,  or application and gives you 
precise and detailed insights on the identified issues.

You can [install Tanaguru by yourself](link to install doc) or use 
[Tanaguru in SaaS](https://my.tanaguru.com/)

## Features

### Four kinds of audit

* offline file audit
* page audit
* entire website audit (Heritrix crawler embedded)
* scenario audit (pages with sign-up, multiple-steps forms, electronic procedures, web applications...)

(That's the DOM that is tested, thus dealing with JS/AJAX/ARIA)

### Accessibility Analytics

 * Metrics to follow your accessibility growth

### Customization

* Create your own rules
* Optimise++ with integration in Quality Assurance tools like Travis, Jenkins...
* multi-lingual: English, Spanish, French, and [any other language you would add](https://crowdin.com/project/tanaguru) :)

## Business: accessibility

What tests are covered ? The ones users like more:

* color contrast with solutions offered
* language change in the page

Other tests they enjoy:

* all usual tests like the "tag and attributes tests" (missing alt, table headers check, frame title...)
* downloadable files / office files (spreadsheet, wordprocessor...)
* switch of context
* and much more tedious silly tests you won't have to deal with

By january 2014, this represents [~170 accessibility tests](http://www.tanaguru.org/en/content/accessiweb-22-coverage)
