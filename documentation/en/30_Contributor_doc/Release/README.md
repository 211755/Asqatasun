# Release a version of Asqatasun

This is the documentation for releasing a new version for Asqatasun. As an end user, you won't need it, it is just for developers.

The process is compound of two main parts:

1. [Releasing a Release Candidate (RC)](Release_RC.md): release, test, eventually iterate
1. [Releasing a Stable version](Release_Stable.md) and launching communication.

## Versioning

We tend to follow the [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) recommendations.
