# Hardware provisioning for Asqatasun

* RAM: 4 Gb
* CPU: dual core (the more, the faster)
* Disk: 10Go

## Notes on disk performance / usage

* For large (>10000 pages) and repetitive audits, a hardware RAID controller
increases perfomances in a really significant way !
* Statistically speaking, an audited page is about 0.3Mb on disk.
